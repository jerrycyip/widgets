# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project comprises several widgets supporting functionality ranging from basic expandable accordion and dropdown functionality, to a text search bar using [Wikipedia's search api](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search) and a text translation widget using [Google's translate api](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest/v2/translate).  These different widgets are connected with a navigation menu and supporting router.  We leverage [Semantic UI's](https://semantic-ui.com/) free stylesheet for styling our app (stylesheet href link included in index.html) - this saves time and ensures the project's primary focus is practicing React JS concepts.

This project is one of the practice exercises for Stephen Grider's Udemy course, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/).  The project helps practice using core React JS concepts including the following: (with emphasis on concepts 12 & 13) 

1) Building Content with JSX
2) Communicating with Props
3) Structuring Apps with Class-Based Components
4) State in React Component
5) Understanding Lifecycle Methods
6) Handling User Input with Forms and Events
7) Making API Requests with React
8) Building Lists of Records
9) Using Ref's for DOM Access
10) Using Ref's for DOM Access
11) Testing React Mastery (thus far)
12) Understanding Hooks in React
13) Navigation From Scratch

## Setting up the APIs
### Step 1: Sign-up for developer API keys
This project uses the [Google's translate api](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest/v2/translate).  To use Google's Translate API, you can sign up for a free Google developer API key from the link above or otherwise leverage the React course provided API key included in this project (note: key is restricted to only work from localhost:3000).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
